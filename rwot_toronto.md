# Toronto Rebooting Web of Trust

Toronto is one of the world's most diverse cities. In addition to our [RWoT Code of Conduct]() we'd like to bring attention to the [Guide to Acknowledging First Peoples & Traditional Territory](https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory).

Thanks to Kaliya Young and John Wunderlich for drawing our attention to this important guide.
